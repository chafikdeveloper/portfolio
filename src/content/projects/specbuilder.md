## Introduction
This project was for TiniTec's potential clients to fill a form based on the service they're interested in

## Overview
This was an update and upgrade for an existing project built with Laravel and Livewire. My job was to add a page showcasing all the services and a dynamic form based on the service selected. At the end it generates a PDF with the information has been filled in, and an optional email notification.

## Outcomes
- Using Email notification
- Generating and styling PDFs and populate it with real data from a database

## Technologies
